            <h2>Natural Patterns, natural art</h2>
            <p>
                The inspiration to make the house here in the web, were natural patterns and natural shapes, because the nature is the best engineer and designer, making a natural-eficient environmet. Taking the nature as inspiration is the best option due to the enrgy-eficient proceses it uses and natural patterns that follow mathematical formula, as for example the ones here below(e.g. Shells, Branches, Cracks, etc.).

            <h2>Eco-friendly house, Eco-friendly life</h2>
            <p>
                In a house most of the products used in daily life are not eco-friendly, the Evergreen houses team work hard to make the selection of the best eco-friendly products, as using some natural energies such as sun light, replacing most of the artificial light, using solar panels to perform lights in night without using to much energy is a helpful way to reduce ou environmetal impact.
