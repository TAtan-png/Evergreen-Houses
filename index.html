            <h2>Natural Patterns, natural art</h2>
            <p>
                The inspiration to make the house here in the web, were natural patterns and natural shapes, as for example the ones here below(e.g. Shells, Branches, Cracks, etc.).

            <h2>Eco-friendly house, Eco-friendly life</h2>
            <p>
                In a house most of the products used in daily life are not eco-friendly, we, the Evergreen houses team work hard to make the selection of the best eco-friendly products, as using some natural energies as sun light replacing most of the artificial lights and using solal panels to perform lights in night without using so much energy.
